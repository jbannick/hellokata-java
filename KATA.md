## Martial Arts Kata

Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"), a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. 

The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese martial arts in general.

The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. 

There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations.
