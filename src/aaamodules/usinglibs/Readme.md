These Kata show how to build modularized apps that use libraries that are modularized, partially modularized, or not modularized, including:
- A modularized HelloWorld that uses a non-modularized third-party library
- A modularized HelloWorld that uses the partially modularized Log4J2 library
- A modularized HelloWorld that uses the fully modularized part of the Log4J2 library
- A simple modularized app which parses CSV and writes JSON using 4 libraries: 3 totally non-modularized and 1 partially modularized
