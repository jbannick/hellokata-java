These Kata show how to build Modularized libraries and apps that use them, including:
- A simple modularized library called by a non-modularized app
- That library called by a modularized app
- A multi-release library called by a Java 7 app and a non-modularized Java 9 app
- That library called by a Java 7 app and modularized Java 9 and Java 10 apps
