These Kata show how to build modularized apps that use libraries that are modularized, partially modularized, or not modularized, including:
- A HelloWorld that uses a third-party library that is originally non-modularized, that we HACK to make modularized
- A HelloWorld that uses the partially modularized Log4J2 library
- A simple app which parses CSV and writes JSON using 4 libraries: 3 totally non-modularized and 1 partially modularized
