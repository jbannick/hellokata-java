## Martial Arts Kata

"Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"), a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. 

The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese martial arts in general.

The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. 

There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. "

## Code Kata

"More recently kata has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense, referring to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement.

Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition. 

The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer..."

"There are 3 parts to the study of karate:

* kihon (basics) – front stance, back stance, lunge punch, reverse punch, snap kick, etc.
* kata (forms) – planned series of movements where a karateka (one who practices karate) seems to fight an invisible opponent
* kumite (sparring) – fighting against a fellow karate student

Kihon is learning the specific techniques, like punches, kicks, stances, etc. 

In kihon, you practice these techniques in isolation, and you repeat each individually over and over and over again. 

To me, coding kihon would be the equivalent of learning the syntax of a language, learning lamda expressions, or learning generics. 

Kihon is not about solving a problem, but rather learning what tools you have available to solve a problem. 

Only after one learns kihon, can a karate student learn kata and kumite."

## Hello Kata

"A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program."
