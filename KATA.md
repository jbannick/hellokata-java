## Martial Arts Kata

"Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"), a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. 

The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese martial arts in general.

The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. 

There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. "

## Code Kata

"More recently kata has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense, referring to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement.

Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition. 

The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer..."

"There are 3 parts to the study of karate:

* kihon (basics) – front stance, back stance, lunge punch, reverse punch, snap kick, etc.
* kata (forms) – planned series of movements where a karateka (one who practices karate) seems to fight an invisible opponent
* kumite (sparring) – fighting against a fellow karate student

Kihon is learning the specific techniques, like punches, kicks, stances, etc. 

In kihon, you practice these techniques in isolation, and you repeat each individually over and over and over again. 

To me, coding kihon would be the equivalent of learning the syntax of a language, learning lamda expressions, or learning generics. 

Kihon is not about solving a problem, but rather learning what tools you have available to solve a problem. 

Only after one learns kihon, can a karate student learn kata and kumite."

## Hello World

"A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.

...the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131101633/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1509096497&sr=1-2&keywords=the+c+programming+language+kernighan+ritchie)."

## Hello Kata

Motivation and Intention:

My job at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu//) as a software architect and coder requires a deep facility  with multiple languages. 

Even novice software engineers know how easy it is to forget pieces of a language when you don't use it for awhile. (Or even that code you wrote two weeks ago.) Software engineers, like medical doctors, tend to know their areas of expertise as it was when they first learned it, but not to follow it as it changes. (Java 7, 8, 9 anyone?) Day-to-day coding is expedience-driven, not lending itself to comprehensive familiarity.

Code Kata are my way to address these issues and stay very good at what I do.

Designing and coding the Kata is a means for achieving a comprehensive knowledge of a language, and  staying current with it.

Practicing those Kata is how I keep my toolset for a specific language fully stocked, even when my job requires working with a different language.

The language facility this brings also lets me focus on architecture rather than just syntax.

So the intention here is comprehensiveness and practice, not explanation.

You won't find the kind of comments I put in my production code. Nor will you find error trapping and event logging. See my Portfolio for those. What you will find is just the simplest code for the task at hand.

Other Folks' Kata: No criticism intended, but they don't do what I want.
Kihon vs. Kata: She's undoubtedly correct; but I like the term Kata more.

You might find these Kata useful for your own professional edge.
