These apps use Log4J2.

To build and run them:

- You must have the Java JDK installed
- You must have log4j-core-2.10.0.jar at LOG4J2_HOME
- You must have log4j-api-2.10.0.jar  at LOG4J2_HOME

Download Log4J2 from: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html

I've built and run them using Java 10.
