These Kata show how to build modularized apps that use libraries that are modularized, partially modularized, not modularized, including:

- A HelloWorld which uses a third-party library that is originally non-modularized, that we make modularized
- A HelloWorld which uses the Log4J2 library that is partially modularized
- A simple app which parses CSV and writes JSON using 4 libraries: 3 totally non-modularized and 1 partially modularized
