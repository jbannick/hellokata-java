“Amateurs practice until they get it right; 
Professionals practice until they can’t get it wrong.”

Harold Craxton, Professor, Royal Academy of Music

These Kata are my form of practice.

## Repo Structure
This repo contains basic Java Kata.
More advanced Kata are in my:
* hellokata-java-intermediate  TBD
* hellokata-java-advanced      TBD

My professional portfolio is at:

* portfolio - TBD

For more on Kata and their application here, see: >>>[KATA](https://github.com/jbannick/hellokata-java/blob/master/KATA.md)
## Java Version
All code has been compiled under Java 9 or 10.

## Code Completeness
This is a work in progress.

I'm working through a list of over 200 Java topics for my Basic Java Kata repo.

As I hit a topic, I study its latest documentation, online tutorials, blogs, eBooks, and StackOverflow posts. I write a first Kata, usually the simplest possible for that topic, and push it up to the repo. 

That Kata executes properly. However, quite often there is more I intend to put in that Kata. There may even be warnings in the compile. (Don't do this in Production!) Those Kata contain TODO comments.

Then I go on to the next topic. 

Periodically, I sweep through my list of topics, complete the set of Kata for that topic, and complete all Kata in that set, including resolving any warnings. Those Kata do not contain TODO comments.

It's more fun that way.
