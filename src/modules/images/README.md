## Custom Images

These Kata are modularized apps that use custom images.

Custom images enable you to ship a custom subset of the Java Runtime Environment along with your app.
This means that the target computer does not require Java to be installed; or can have a different release of Java installed.

From a purely technical perspective, installing a JRE on a target computer is normally no big deal.

It can be a show stopper however, from an administrative perspective, particularly given today's increasing cyber security consciousness.

Custom images are one way to mitigate this.
